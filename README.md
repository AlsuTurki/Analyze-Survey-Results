# Analyze-Survey-Results
In this project, I analyzed a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, 
so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). 
I decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it. 
I used spreadsheets to make my analysis easier

# Why this Project?
This project it introduce me to the data analysis process that i did  using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program.
In this project, I did go through the process of calculating summary statistics
and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students.
The goal is that I not only can perform an analysis, but also that I can communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.

# What skills will I use?

- Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.
- Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.
- Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.
- Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis.
- Being comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those question.s
- Analyze a future dataset using Excel.
